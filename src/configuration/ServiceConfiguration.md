# QWC Services configuration

The architecture of `qwc-services` is as follows:

![QWC Services Arch](../images/qwc-services-arch.png?style=centerme)

- API-Gateway: API Gateway, forwards requests to individual services <http://localhost:8088>
- Auth-Service: Authentication service with local user database (default users: admin:admin, demo:demo) <http://localhost:8088/auth/login>
- Map viewer: QWC2 map viewer <http://localhost:8088>
- OGC Service: Proxy for WMS/WFS requests filtered by permissions, calls QGIS Server <http://localhost:8088/ows/api>
- Admin GUI: Admin GUI <http://localhost:8088/qwc_admin/>

`qwc-docker` ships a pre-configured the `qwc-services` ecosystem as an easy to use application.

## Service configurations

The master configuration file for the QWC services is located at `qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tenant>/tenantConfig.json`, where `<tenant>` is the tenant name, `default` by default. See [Multi Tenancy](../topics/MultiTenancy.md) for more details on tenants.

The file is structured as follows:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-config-generator/raw/master/schemas/qwc-config-generator.json",
  "service": "config-generator",
  "config": {
    <ConfigGenerator config>
  },
  "themesConfig": "./themesConfig.json",
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "<service name",
      <Service config>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Refer to the [`qwc-config-generator` schema](../references/qwc-config-generator.md) for the available `ConfigGenerator config` settings.

`themesConfig` is a relative path to the theme configuration file as documented in [Theme configuration](ThemesConfiguration.md#manual-theme-configuration).

The`services` block contains the configuration for the individual QWC services, as documented in the [reference](../references/index.md).

*Note:* All config settings can also be set as environment variables in capitalized form in `docker-compose.yml`.

*Note:* Some variables must be set as environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:


ENV                   | Default value      | Description
----------------------|--------------------|---------
`INPUT_CONFIG_PATH`   | `config-in`        | Base path for service configuration files
`OUTPUT_CONFIG_PATH`  | `/tmp`             | Base path for service configuration files
`JWT_SECRET_KEY`      | `********`         | secret key for JWT token
`TENANT_URL_RE`       | None               | Regex for tenant extraction from base URL. Example: ^https?://.+?/(.+?)/
`TENANT_HEADER`       | None               | Tenant Header name. Example: Tenant


## Enabling additional services<a name="enabling-services"></a>

* Add service entry in `qwc-services/docker-compose.yml`, setting the service mountpoint:
```
SERVICE_MOUNTPOINT=/<mountpoint>
```
Example:
```yml
  qwc-print-service:
    image: sourcepole/qwc-print-service:vYYYY.MM.DD
    environment:
      <<: *qwc-service-variables
      SERVICE_MOUNTPOINT: '/api/v1/print'
    volumes:
      - ./volumes/config:/srv/qwc_service/config:ro
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5020:9090"
```
* Add corresponding entry in `api-gateway/nginx.conf`, example:
```text
  location /api/v1/print {
    proxy_pass http://qwc-print-service:9090;
  }
```
* If necessary, uncomment/add the respective service url (see also the [qwc-map-viewer schema reference](../references/qwc-map-viewer.md)) in the `mapViewer` config block of `volumes/config-in/default/tenantConfig.json`, i.e.
```json
  {
    "name": "mapViewer",
    "generator_config": {
      # ...
    },
    "config": {
      "print_service_url": "/api/v1/print/",
      # ...
    }
  }
```
* Add the service configuration block below `services` in `volumes/config-in/default/tenantConfig.json`, according to the service config schema, i.e.
```json
  {
    "name": "print",
    "config": {
      "ogc_service_url": "http://qwc-ogc-service:9090/",
      "qgis_server_version": "3.16"
    }
  }
```

## Configuration database

The [Configuration database](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-config-db) (ConfigDB) contains the database schema `qwc_config` for configurations and permissions of QWC services.

This database uses the PostgreSQL connection service `qwc_configdb` by default, which can be setup for the corresponding database in the PostgreSQL connection service file `qwc-docker/pg_service.conf`.

To use an external configuration database, either change the connection definition for `qwc_configdb` in `qwc-docker/pg_service.conf` or change the `config_db_url` in `qwc-docker/volumes/config-in/<tenant>/tenantConfig.json`.

### Database migrations

An existing ConfigDB can be updated to the latest schema by running the database migrations from the `qwc-config-db` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-config-db.git
cd qwc-config-db/
# Install alembic, either globally or activate python virtualenv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
alembic upgrade head
```
*Note:* The `qwc_configdb` service definition must exist in the host, for instance:
```bash
cat $HOME/.pg_service.conf
[qwc_configdb]
host=localhost
port=5439
dbname=qwc_demo
user=qwc_admin
password=qwc_admin
sslmode=disable
```

## Keeping QWC services up to date

When using `qwc-docker`, updating the services is a simple as updating the image tags in `qwc-docker/docker-compose.yml`.

Two versioning schemes are available:

- `vYYYY-MM-DD`: These refer to the latest available version of the respective images (i.e. `v2023.05.12`).
- `vYYYY.X-lts`: These refer to the long term support version of the respective images (i.e. `v2023.1-lts`).

You can always check the available tags on dockerhub, for example at (https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcepole/qwc-config-generator)[https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcepole/qwc-config-generator].

The [`qwc-docker` Upgrade Notes](../release_notes/QwcDockerUpgradeNotes.md) documents major changes, and in particular all incompatible changes between releases which require changes to the application specific code and/or configuration.
